------steps--------!

1. create a folder and inside them using command create-react-app and named project name
2. Install all the liberary and dependencies
3. Also insall SASS for designing the page
4. Have installl react chart for showing data === Recharts and apexChart

## Approach

I had go through the design and get how to implement the basic structure and design using Sass(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets).Using React-router-dom i had done Navbarto navigate the components then i have created individual components for reuseability. after that i focused on how to implement a map using react-simple-map go through the react simple map and design and implement step by step as such possible. After that i thought about how to implement graphs like Bar chart , bubble chart and scatter charts i had read about on how how to implement and apply on my project so i done using ApexChart library,react charts and i implemented the bubble chart using JSX and SASS.  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
